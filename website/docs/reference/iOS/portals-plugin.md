The [PortalsPlugin](./portals-plugin) class is a Capacitor Plugin that allows for bi-directional communication between Android code and Web code. It is not meant to be used directly.

This Plugin comes with three functions: `subscribeNative`, `unsubscribeNative`, and `publishNative`; that are used in the web application.

Please see the PORTAL PLUGIN TUTORIAL // TODO HERE for an example of how to use this Plugin.
