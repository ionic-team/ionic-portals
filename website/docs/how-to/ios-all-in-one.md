# iOS Quick Start Walkthrough

This is a walkthrough on how to get a single Portal + web application setup. To begin this walkthrough it will be assumed that you have already signed up for access to Portals and you have your Portals key ready.

First have your web application ready. We will add some configuration to it and then get it setup in Appflow.

## 1. Create a capacitor config

Create a `capacitor.config.json` file to the root of your web project. We will not need to add Capacitor to the web project but this configuration file will help us configure some options for the Portals that is displaying this web application.

```json
{
  "appId": "com.ionicframework.featured-products",
  "appName": "Featured Products",
  "webDir": "build"
}
```

These configuration values are required for web applications added to Appflow.

- `appId`, a unique id that you provide to your web application
- `appName`
- `webDir`, the directory where your compiled web code will be placed

:::note
There are many options that you can provide to a Capacitor configuration file we will only need a few to get started.
:::

## 2. Add the web application to Appflow

Now that we have the application source configured we will need to add it to Appflow. Appflow will be used for deploying the web application into the Portal.

During the Native App build process the most recent build of the web application will be used to seed the Portal, and then after the Native App deployment every subsequent build can be deployed as an over the air LiveUpdate.

### Connect the repo

After logging into your [Appflow](https://dashboard.ionicframework.com/) account go to the Apps page.

In the upper right hand corner you will be able to select `Import existing app`.

<em><img src={useBaseUrl("/img/start-by-adding-an-app.webp")} width="50%"/></em>
<em><img src={useBaseUrl("/img/import-existing-app.webp")} width="50%"/></em>

- Provide an `App Name`. Most likely using the same you provided in the `capacitor.config.json` file in the previous step.
- `Capacitor`, as the mobile architecture
- Choose your git host. In this example we have selected `Github`

### Build the connected application

After the application has been added to Appflow you will need to create your first build so that it is available to seed the Portal in the Native App.

This can be done by hitting the `New Build` button on the 'Builds' page. Then you will choose a the most recent commit to create the build from.

<em><img src={useBaseUrl("/img/create-a-new-build.webp")} width="50%"/></em>
<em><img src={useBaseUrl("/img/create-a-new-build-selected.webp")} width="50%"/></em>

When creating a new build there are a few values that we need to change on the initial build for the app.

- `Target Platform` should be `JS`
- `Build Stack` should just be the default which is the latest.
- `Live update` should be turned on and `Channel` should be set to `production`

## 3. Setup local dev environment

Now that we have the web application all setup in Appflow and built we need to get our local environment setup to be able to pull it from Appflow.

The first step in setting up our local environment is [generating a personal access token](https://dashboard.ionicframework.com/settings/personal-access-tokens).

This is done from `Personal Settings` in the `Personal Access Token` tab.

<em style={{
  textAlign: 'center',
  display: 'block'
}}>
<img src={useBaseUrl("/img/personal-access-token.webp")} width="75%"/>
</em>

Click the `Generate new token` button. While creating the token it is a best practice to give it an optional expiration date but not required.

:::note
After the token is generated you will need to copy it to clipboard because it will be required for the next step. Usually the token follows the format of `ion_XXXXXXXXXXXXX`.
:::

### Create a cloud configuration file

Now create a yaml configuration file in your native project. This file will be used to authenticate against Appflow for your cloud interactions. Usually you will place this file in your native applications source root. It will be referenced by a build script in your native application.

```yaml title=.ionic-cloud.yaml
TOKEN: ion_XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

:::note
Be sure to set this to ignore in your `.gitignore` [Learn more about the configuration file.](https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/cli/overview#authentication)

:::

### Install the Ionic Cloud CLI

Install the Ionic Cloud CLI within your local dev environment. This CLI will allow us to interact with Appflow programmatically. So that we can pull the latest Build files during native builds.
(https://ionic.io/docs/appflow/cli/overview)

```bash
(export IONIC_CLOUD_VERSION=0.7.0; curl -sL https://ionic.io/get-ionic-cloud-cli | bash)
```

## 4. Install Portals into your iOS Application

Install the Cocoapod file

:::note
IonicPortals requires using Cocoapods 1.10 or greater.
:::

To add Portals to your iOS project, put the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby title=Podfile
pod 'IonicPortals', '~> ${getPortalsVersionIos()}'
```

And then run `pod install`.

### Pull latest web application build from Appflow

Now letâ€™s go to the iOS project in XCode.

Setup the build script

```bash
# APP_ID - AppFlow AppId for your web application
# CHANNEL - AppFlow distribution channel. production is the default channel
# PORTAL_NAME - Choose a name for the portal

APP_ID=c65939c1
CHANNEL=production
PORTAL_NAME=featured_product

ionic-cloud live-update download \
  --config="${SOURCE_ROOT}/.ionic-cloud.yaml" \
  --app-id ${APP_ID} \
  --channel-name ${CHANNEL} \
  --zip-name ${PORTAL_NAME}.zip


unzip ${PORTAL_NAME}.zip -d \
  ${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${TARGET_NAME}.app/${PORTAL_NAME}
rm ${PORTAL_NAME}.zip
```

### Configure our first Portal

Add our first Portal
https://ionic.io/docs/portals/getting-started/iOS

```swift title=AppDelegate.swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    PortalsRegistrationManager.shared.register(key: "MY_API_KEY")
    return true
}
```
