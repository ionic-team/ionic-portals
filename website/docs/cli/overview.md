# Portals CLI

The Portals CLI is a command-line tool designed to simplify and streamline the management and deployment of your Portals projects. It empowers developers to interact with Portals programmatically, automating common tasks and enhancing productivity. The CLI provides functionality for both Native Developers and Web Developers.

The CLI is a companion tool but is not required to use Portals.
