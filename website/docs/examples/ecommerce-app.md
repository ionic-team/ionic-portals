The Ionic Team has put together an E-commerce demo application for Android and iOS that uses both native layouts and web-based portals. The Android application uses Fragments while the iOS application uses Storyboard/ViewController based views.

Below is a list of which portions of the app are native and which portions of the app are portals.

Native Screens

- List of Products Screen
- Individual Product Screen
- Cart Screen

Web Screens

- Checkout Screen
- Help Screen
- User Details Screen
