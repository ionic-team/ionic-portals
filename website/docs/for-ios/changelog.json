This API offers a set of configuration options that closely align with those found in the Capacitor configuration file ( options detailed [here](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/config)) . For comprehensive details, please refer to the  \"Advanced Configuration\" section [here](https://ionic.io/docs/portals/for-ios/how-to/advanced-configuration).\n\n### Development Mode\n\nWe have now introduced a development mode for web developers. The `devModeEnabled` property is now available on Portal, allowing you to control to give a better development experience for your web developers. \n\nIn this mode, the Portal web content can be substituted with content from a development server URL, which complements the `portals serve ios` CLI command. Usage docs can be found [here](https://ionic.io/docs/portals/cli/commands/serve-ios). More than likely web developers will use Development Mode in conjunction with a locally running web server so that development and testing can be done within an emulator on a physical device.\n\nPlease note that this mode is enabled by default and exclusively accessible during debug builds. For release modes, the application will consistently use the included content. To deactivate development mode for a Portal, you can easily set `devModeEnabled` to `false`, either during Portal initialization or by directly modifying the property. Explore this feature to optimize your development workflow with Ionic Portals.\n\nTo upgrade from the previous release please reference the [UPGRADE GUIDE](https://ionic.io/docs/portals/for-ios/upgrade-guides#portals-for-ios-080--090).\n\n### What's Changed\n* **feat**: Add ability to configure capacitor programmatically through `Portal` ([#77](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-portals-ios/pull/77))\n* **feat**: Add dev mode ([#78](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-portals-ios/pull/78))",
