The [PortalBuilder](./portal-builder) class is used to create a [Portal](./portal) instance. It follows a [Builder Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) to construct a portal using values passed in at runtime. [PortalBuilder](./portal-builder) can be used in situations where you want to programmatically create a single [Portal](./portal)  at runtime rather than defining it via XML. For managing multiple [Portal](./portal) instances in an application, it is recommended to use the [PortalManager](./portal-manager) class.

An example of how to create a [Portal](./portal) using the [PortalBuilder](./portal-builder) class is directly below.
