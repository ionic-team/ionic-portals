Ionic Portals is a supercharged native Web View component for iOS and Android that lets you add web-based experiences to native mobile apps. It enables native and web teams to better collaborate and bring new and existing web experiences to mobile in a safe, controlled way.

## Getting Started

See our docs to [get started with Portals](https://ionic.io/docs/portals/getting-started/guide).

## Registration

The Ionic Portals libraries for [Android](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-portals-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-portals-ios) require a **free** license key to use. Once you have integrated Portals into your project, login to your ionic account to get a key. See our doc on [how to register for free and get your Portals license key](https://ionic.io/docs/portals/how-to/get-a-product-key) and refer to the [Android](https://ionic.io/docs/portals/getting-started/android) or [iOS](https://ionic.io/docs/portals/getting-started/iOS) getting started guides to see where to add your key.

## FAQ

### Where is the iOS and Android Code?

This repo contains the documentation and web plugin code for Portals. The [Android](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-portals-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-portals-ios) native libraries are split into their own repos to more easily version and release for their respective platforms.

### What is the pricing for Portals use?

Portals is free to use in non-production environments. Businesses with more than USD $1 million in annual revenue are required to purchase a license from Ionic before using Portals in production.

### Is Portals Open Source?

See the [license](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-portals/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

### How is Portals Related to Capacitor and Ionic?

Ionic Portals is a solution that lets you add web-based experiences to your native mobile apps. Portals uses [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) as a bridge between the native code and the web code to allow for cross-communication between the two layers. Because Portals uses Capacitor under the hood, you are able to use any existing [Capacitor Plugins](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/plugins) and even most [Cordova Plugins](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/plugins/cordova) while continuing to use your existing native workflow.

[Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) is the open source mobile app development framework that makes it easy to build top quality native and progressive web apps with web technologies. You can develop your web experiences with Ionic, but it's not necessary to use Portals.
